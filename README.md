Daily Focus: Users should be able to identify and set their primary task for the day. This feature ensures a clear sense of purpose and prioritization.

Customized Pomodoro: Recognizing that the traditional 25-5-15 Pomodoro technique may not work for everyone, our tool should allow users to tailor their work and break intervals to suit their preferences and productivity patterns.

YouTube Integration: Users can play songs directly from YouTube URLs or playlists to create a personalized and motivating work environment.

Website Blocking: The tool should offer the option to block distracting websites, including social media or other custom sites, during deep work sessions. Experimentation with blocking strategies is encouraged to find what works best for individual users.
